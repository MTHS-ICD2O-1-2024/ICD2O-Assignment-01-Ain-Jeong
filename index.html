    <h2>American Computer Scientist</h2>
    <h3>About Her</h3>
    <p>Barbara Liskov is an American computer scientist known for her pioneering work in programming languages, software
    engineering, and distributed computing. She developed the Liskov Substitution Principle, a key concept in
    object-oriented programming that helps ensure software reliability. Liskov also led the development of the CLU
    programming language, which influenced later languages like Python and Java. Her contributions to distributed systems
    and fault tolerance have been foundational, and in 2008 she received the Turing Award for her groundbreaking research in
    programming methodology and software design.</p>
