    <h2>Barbara Liskov's Contributions</h2>
    <p>
    Barbara Liskov is renowned for her work in programming languages and software design. Her most significant contribution
    is the Liskov Substitution Principle, which asserts that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a
    subclass without altering the correctness of the program. This principle has become a cornerstone of object-oriented
    programming and helps ensure more reliable and maintainable software. Additionally, Liskov contributed to the
    development of the CLU programming language, further influencing the evolution of programming practices and software
    engineering.
